# Burnouts F1 Podcast Repo

Welcome to the repository of the Burnouts F1 Podcast. This is where all the code, data, and scripts will live for our podcast for people to explore on their own. As we add new code to the podcast, it will all live here. This README shoud serve as a basic guide with more documetnation coming later.

## PyBurnout: The Podcast Package

PyBurnout is our own little package that we are building for helpful analysis. For now we only have one scraper for the FIA's decision documentation site to download docs as they come, but as we add more tools we will document them on this github.

## Notebooks

The notebooks folder will have all of our different Python and R notebooks for data analysis that we do on the podcast. As more episodes get complete, we will be publishing more scripts and notebooks under here. While not every episode will have full on data analysis, there should always be some sort of script to run.
